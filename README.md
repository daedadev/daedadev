### Hi There ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Daniel Moore and I am a software developer with a background in music located Southern California. My language of choice is Javascript and my instrument of choice is the Oboe.
MySQL for the amazing relational database handling and buffet for one of the best composite oboes around. I am seeking to build the future and am looking to learning daily to dive
further into tech.
